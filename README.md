### Primitive recursive functions

The implementation of five primitive recursive functions with the recursive
data type Nat and the recursor for natural numbers recNat is developed.

The following functions are realized:
- Identity function
- Constant functions
- Multiplication function
- Predecessor function
- Truncated subtraction function

#### Operating system version
-  Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS

#### The following versions are used for this purpose:
-  The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 9.6.1
(GHC version 9.6.1)
